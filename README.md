# Counter Application

My very first Pheonix application and its inspired from ['dwyl repo'](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-counter-tutorial).

  * To start webserver `mix phx.server`

## Final output will look like
We are running this app on two different nodes and the counter will always be syncronised and that is the beauty of live view.
